# Cellular-localisation-and-counting
The code is split into three notebooks. HED contains the code for stain separation, saving the images as 256x256 and as 512x512 inputs for pix2pix. The pix2pix file contains the pix2pix model. The baseline file contains the HoverNet basline code used in the CoNIC challenge.
All the files have been run successfully on Google Colab and all of the contain all the libraries needed the for them to work with the exception of the baseline. The first cell in the baseline notebook instal the tiatool box on colab, run that cell and upon completion restart runtime to apply the changes. The cell must me be run every time the notebook is open. The baseline file has dependencies to other files present in the CoNIC challenge Github repository which have not been added here but can be accesed through the link: https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/CoNIC .
